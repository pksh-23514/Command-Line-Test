# Command-Line-Test

## Introduction:
Command line test is a BASH shell based tool that simulates login based online testing scenario. Initially the user will be provided with a sign-in option where pre-defined users will be allowed to log in. Upon successful login this tool will display questions for the user from existing data-base. It will also handle error conditions like time-out. This tool will also store answers provided by users for future verification.

These days there are a lot of online test platform which enables students to take tests online. They will typically have a user-interface, backend question bank and evaluation part. They will also support other features like predefined time per question, output reports etc. The idea of this project is to simulate such an online test interface using Linux Shell Scripting and commands. 

By  implementing this Linux Shell Scripting Projects for Beginners Project will make you apply Shell programming constructs (ex: loops), Pattern matching commands (ex: grep, sed etc…) and File handling (ex: permission, directories etc…) aspects during implementation.
